# 🔶 ORDO Full — the whole layer

The one install that fixes the annoyances: Lean's compaction **plus** the auto-router, the gates (opt-in), the
bundled tools, and persistence that grows with the project.

## Install
```bash
npx ordo init        # or: /plugin marketplace add SprucetheAI/ordo → /plugin install
```
Drops `.claude/skills/ordo/SKILL.md` + the operating profile + 16 gate-spec references + `.ordo/`
(`ledger.md` + `lessons.md` + `mcp.json.example`).

## What you get (on top of Lean)
- **Auto-router** — `classifyTask()` decides which part fires per task (light → just compress; hard → arm the
  ledger + the right gate). You never pick.
- **The gates + long-form discipline (opt-in, honest)** — REFEED / experimentalist / evaluation / autonomy /
  context-rot, classify-first. *ORDO fills raw-Opus gaps, it doesn't remodel.* The SHORT-task quality lifts **wash**
  on a frontier model (measured) — but the real value is **long-form / context**: goal-lock over a session + the
  ledger + rot-compaction hold the goal at the front and survive context rot past ~50K (grounded in the rot
  literature — the actual raw-Opus gap). Off by default; opt-in.
- **Bundled tools, compaction-wrapped (the differentiator):** a web **crawler** (firecrawl) + **social scraper**
  (apify), Claude Code's **native PDF**, and **video sight** (ffmpeg keyframes → native image vision via
  `tools/video_frames.py` — no fake MCP). The value-add is **compacting every tool's output**: crawl **−62%**,
  transcript **−46%**, PDF **−24%** (measured, `python tools/mcp_compact_ab.py` → `tools/mcp-compact-ab.json`). See
  [`../../spec/mcp-bundle.md`](../../spec/mcp-bundle.md).
- **Persistence that grows with the project** — the skill reads `.ordo/ledger.md` (goal + decisions) at the start
  of a hard task and appends as it works; lessons accrete to `.ordo/lessons.md`. A human-run evidence loop —
  **not** autonomous self-growth (that claim is a measured null).

## What you DON'T get (the honest bounds)
- Not a magic quality/IQ boost (washes on a frontier model). Not "faster" (unclocked). Not a turnkey video MCP
  (add-slot only). Not autonomous growth. Every one of those is named in [`GTM-REALITY.md`](../GTM-REALITY.md).

## For
"The one install for all of it." Auto-fires + auto-routes; mention it once, it runs nonstop.
