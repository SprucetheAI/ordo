"""pillars — the test-gated quality scoreboard. Runs every DETERMINISTIC gate live; holds the
agent-judged pillars (P3 speed, P4 quality, P5 hallucination, P7 architecture, P8 rework) with their
recorded evidence + status. The scorecard is the single source of truth — no pillar shows a number that
a gate didn't produce. See spec/pillars.md.
