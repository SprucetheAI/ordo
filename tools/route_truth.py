"""route_truth — the COMPUTED misroute-cost harness for classifyTask (charter §2).

Replaces the meaningless "100% inter-rater consistency" with a real, deterministic misroute number against an
OUTCOME-pinned ground-truth corpus (tools/route_corpus.jsonl, content-hashed). ASYMMETRIC cost (FrugalGPT's
2-axis objective made concrete): over-spend (STRICT on a true-LIGHT) is a bounded ~1-unit tax; under-verify
(LIGHT on a true-STRICT) is weight 10 AND a HARD-FLOOR violation when the item is irreversible. No judge in the
loop — string-equality to a frozen label — so it is COMPUTED and un-gameable.

Honesty: `ordo_rule` is scored on the corpus's GOLD signals → it measures whether the 5-trigger TAXONOMY is
complete (0 misroute = every STRICT case has a trigger), NOT real-world extraction. The real classifyTask number
(a MODEL extracts the 5 signals from the raw prompt) is PENDING; `keyword_router` is the runnable-now no-model
extraction floor. Run: `python tools/route_truth.py`.
